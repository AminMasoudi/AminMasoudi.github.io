Hi, I’m Amin — a backend developer and computer science student who enjoys building clean systems, solving complex problems, and working close to the metal.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably halfway up a rock wall. Whether in code or climbing, I care about structure, stability, and the satisfaction of solving challenges from the ground up.

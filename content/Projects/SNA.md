# Graph-Based Social Network Analysis

**Project:** A Graph-Based Social Network Analysis Tool

**Objective:**

Your task is to design and implement a program that analyzes a social network represented as a graph. The program should allow users to input the graph, specify query parameters, and retrieve meaningful insights about the network.

**Graph Representation:**

The social network will be represented as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix, where each node represents a person, organization, or entity, and edges represent relationships between them (e.g., friendships, followers, 
collaborations).

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Node Information Retrieval:** Write a function that takes a node ID as input and returns the node's attributes (e.g., name, age, profession).
2. **Edge Traversal:** Implement an algorithm to traverse the graph, starting from a given node, and retrieve all nodes reachable within a specified distance (e.g., 1-3 hops).
3. **Community Detection:** Use a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) to identify communities within the network based on edge connections.
4. **Centrality Measures:** Calculate various centrality measures (e.g., degree, closeness, betweenness) for each node in the graph.
5. **Querying:** Develop an interface that allows users to input queries and retrieve relevant information about the social network. Examples of queries:
	* Find all nodes connected to a given node within a specific distance.
	* Identify the most central nodes in the network.
	* Retrieve the community structure of the network.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Efficiency:** The program should be able to handle large-scale social networks efficiently, with acceptable running times and memory usage.
2. **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive, allowing users to easily input queries and retrieve results.
3. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected graph structures.

**Deliverables:**

1. A written report (5-7 pages) that:
	* Describes the graph representation and algorithms used.
	* Discusses the functional and non-functional requirements.
	* Presents any challenges encountered during implementation and how they were addressed.
2. A working program (Python, Java, or C++) with a user-friendly interface that demonstrates the above features.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Correctness of implemented algorithms and data structures.
2. Efficiency and scalability of the program.
3. Usability and intuitiveness of the user interface.
4. Clarity and organization of the written report.
5. Creativity and originality in approach to problem-solving.

This project allows you to demonstrate your understanding of graph data structures, as well as your ability to design and implement algorithms for traversing, clustering, and analyzing graphs.
